\section{METHODOLOGY}

The first step was to define mathematical models of the prototype vehicle DT1 and the track. 
A formulation was then proposed for the optimal control problem (OCP) to find the optimal driving strategy and gear ratio. 
Accordingly, this proposed OPC was solved utilizing MATLAB and the FALCON.m library.

\subsection{Modeling of vehicle dynamics}

A simple model of the vehicle's dynamics was used. 
Only the longitudinal dynamics was modeled. Aerodynamic drag did not consider wind effect. 
Tire rolling resistance was independent of temperature, pressure, or speed. 
Bearing friction was zero. The battery and power converter were treated as ideal. 
The dynamics of the inductor in the motor were disregarded. 
A white-box model was derived by using the fundamental principles that describe the system's behaviour. 
The following equation that describes the longitudinal dynamics was derived from the application of Newton’s second law in the vehicle, as represented in Fig.~\ref{fig:diag_forcas_veiculo}. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:modelo_1}
	\begin{split}
		\left( m_v + m_p + m_r \right) \ddot x(t) = F_t - (F_a + F_g + F_r) \enspace,\\ 
		m_r = \frac{N_r \cdot J_r + J_m\cdot \varphi^2 }{r_r^2} \enspace,\\ 
		F_{t} =  K_t \cdot i(t) \cdot \eta \cdot \frac{\varphi}{r_r} \enspace,\\
        F_{a} = \frac{\rho \cdot a_f \cdot c_d \cdot {\dot x(t)}^2}{2} \enspace,\\
        F_{g} = (m_v + m_p) \cdot g \cdot \sin(\theta(x)) \enspace,\\
        F_{r}  = c_{r} \cdot (m_v + m_p) \cdot g \cdot \cos(\theta(x)) \enspace,
	\end{split}
\end{equation}


\noindent where $m_v$ is the mass of the vehicle, $m_p$ is the mass of the pilot, $m_r$ is mass equivalent to the moment of inertia of the rotating parts 
(i.e., wheels and engine axle), $x$ is the position, $\varphi$ is the gear ratio, $F_{t}$ is the propulsive force, $i$ is the electric current in the motor, $F_{a}$ is the aerodynamic drag, $F_g$ is the component 
of the weight that is the direction of speed, $F_{r}$ is the rolling resistance of tires on the track, and $\theta$ is the slope of the track. The model constants are shown in Tab. \ref{tab:constantes}.
The experimental validation of this model has not been performed.

\subsection{Track modeling}

In 2018 and 2019, SEM Americas was held at the Sonoma Raceway. 
It is expected that the track will remain the same for the next editions of the competition. 
\citet{site:dados_sonoma} made available GPS data collected on the Sonoma Raceway track in 2018. 
This data were used for track modeling. The layout of one lap in Sonoma Raceway is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pista}, peaks of elevations are indicated with a triangle, valleys with a square. 

The track’s relative altitude $h$ was approximated by a sum of sines with 8 terms
\footnote{The fit was implemented in MATLAB using the command \lstinline[style=Matlab-editor]{fit(x, h, 'sin8')}}.  
The approximation with trigonometric functions was chosen because of the periodicity of these functions. 
In this way, it would be possible to represent all track laps in a continuous function. 
Using continuous functions instead of interpolating values in tables reduces the computational cost.
The slope model $\theta$ was obtained by deriving the altitude model with respect to $x$:
\[ \theta(x) = arctg\left( \frac{\mathrm{d}h(x)}{\mathrm{d}x}  \right)  \]
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:modeloTheta}
	\theta(x) = \operatorname{arc\,tan} \left( \sum_{n = 1}^{8} a_n \cdot \cos(b_n \cdot x + c_n) \right)
	\enspace,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the coefficients $a_n$, $b_n$ and $c_n$ are presented in Tab.~\ref{tab:coeficientes}. The fitted curve and the data are displays in Fig.~\ref{fig:altitude_pista}

\subsection{Formulation and solution of the optimal control problem}

An optimal control problem aims to determine the parameters and control sequences of a system that will minimize a defined cost.
Using the vehicle model in Eq.~(\ref{eq:modelo_1}), the track model in Eq.~(\ref{eq:modeloTheta}), and the SEM competition rules, the following formulation was used for the optimal control problem.

\begin{mini!}
	{i(t), \varphi, T}{\int_{0}^{T} i(t) \cdot \left(i(t) \cdot R_a + \frac{K_v \cdot \dot x(t) \cdot \varphi}{r_r} \right) \,\mathrm{d}t \label{eq:ObjOCP_final}}
	{\label{eq:formulacaoOCP_final}}{}
    \addConstraint{x(0) = \dot x(0)}{=0 \label{eq:C1_OCP_final}}{}
    \addConstraint{\dot v(t) - \frac{F_t - (F_a + F_g + F_r)}{(m_v + m_p + m_r)}}{=0, \quad}{t \in \left[0,T\right]  \label{eq:C4_OCP_final}}
	\addConstraint{i(t)-\frac{u_{bat}-K_v\cdot(\dot x(t) \cdot \varphi/r_r)}{R_a}}{\leq 0, \quad}{t \in \left[0,T\right]  \label{eq:C5_OCP_final}}
    \addConstraint{0 \leq i(t)}{\leq i_{max}, \quad}{t \in \left[0,T\right]  \label{eq:C6_OCP_final}}
    \addConstraint{0 \leq \dot x(t)}{\leq v_{max}, \quad}{t \in \left[0,T\right]  \label{eq:C7_OCP_final}}
	\addConstraint{\varphi_{min}\leq \varphi}{ \leq \varphi_{max} \label{eq:C10_OCP_final}}{}
    \addConstraint{x(T)}{= x_f \label{eq:C8_OCP_final}}{}
    \addConstraint{T}{\leq t_{max}, \label{eq:C9_OCP_final}}{}
\end{mini!}

\noindent where 

\begin{itemize}
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:ObjOCP_final}) defines the electric energy consumed as the cost to minimize,
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C1_OCP_final}) is a constraint for the initial states of distance traveled and velocity null, 
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C4_OCP_final}) is a constraint  that ensure that the reset states respect the dynamics of the vehicle model, 
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C5_OCP_final}) is a path constraint to current due to the maximum battery voltage, 
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C6_OCP_final}) is a constraint for the maximum current, 
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C7_OCP_final}) is a constraint to the maximum car speed value set by the competition organization,

    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C8_OCP_final}) is a fixed end value constraint for the distance traveled, and 
    \item[ ] Eq.~(\ref{eq:C9_OCP_final}) is a constraint to the maximum end time.
  \end{itemize}

The constants in Eq.~(\ref{eq:formulacaoOCP_final}) are DT1 specifications and SEM rules. The constants values are shown in Tab.~\ref{tab:constantes_OCP}.
The maximum time constant $t_{max}$ was determined utilizing a safety margin of \SI{3.68}{\percent} (\SI{51.52}{\second}) to satisfy the \SI{25.0}{km/h} of minimal average speed required on SEM rules. 
This value of $t_{max}$ is equivalent to \SI{25.92}{km/h} of average speed.  
The total distance constant $x_f$ was determined considering that the distance covered in a lap on the track is 1440 meters.

FALCON.m is a free-use\footnote{The license can be requested at \url{https://www.fsd.lrg.tum.de/software/falcon-m}} software library for MATLAB, 
developed at the Institute of Flight System Dynamics of the Technische Universit{\"a}t M{\"u}nchen to solve and analyze optimal control problems \citep{manual:Falcon}. 
The OCP of Eq.~(\ref{eq:formulacaoOCP_final}) was solved using FALCON.m. The source code developed in this step was made using available open-source software.\footnote{Available for download at \url{https://github.com/michaelfsb/ocp_dt1}}

In a direct current motor, the electric current is controlled through the applied voltage. 
The electric current was chosen as the control variable instead of the voltage because the motor is decoupled from the transmission when it is off. 
Decoupling the motor can only be represented by a discontinuous function, and this causes an increase in computational complexity in the OCP solution.
The voltage required to produce the electrical current in the optimal case was calculated from the following equation

\begin{equation}
    u(t)=\begin{dcases*}
      R_a \cdot i(t) + K_v \cdot \frac{x(t) \cdot \varphi}{r_r} , & \text{if $i(t)>0$},\\
      0, & \text{otherwise}.
    \end{dcases*}
